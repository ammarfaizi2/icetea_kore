# Kore can be used as a network layer if it was
# built with NOHTTP=1.
#
# With this you can bind a callback for every new
# connection that has been established. For TLS connections
# the callback is called after the TLS handshake is completed.

# We must load the module first as we need the callback from it.

# Listen on port 8888 and call connection_setup for each new connection.

# We must still define a domain to use TLS. This might go away
# in the future for NOHTTP=1
